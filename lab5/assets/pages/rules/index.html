                <p>The playing field is a square board measuring 8x8 cells, similar to a chess board. Verticals (columns) are designated by Latin letters from a to h, and horizontals (rows) by numbers from 1 to 8. Unlike chess, not all fields are considered game, but only dark fields</p>
                <p>Each side has 12 checkers at the beginning of the game. The checkers are placed on the three horizontal lines closest to the players. In particular, white checkers are located on squares a1, c1, e1, g1, b2, d2, f2, h2, a3, c3, e3 and g3, and black checkers, respectively, on squares h8, f8, d8, b8, g7, e7 , c7, a7, h6, f6, d6 and b6. The two central rows of fields remain free.</p>

A quiet move is possible if the corresponding square is free and there is no need to capture the opponent’s checker anywhere on the board. For example, the correct move from the initial position would be to move a checker from square c3, for example to d4 (in the game notation this is denoted as c3-d4), or to b4 (c3-b4).</p>

During its move, a checker must capture (capture) the opponent’s checker if it is on an adjacent (diagonally) field and if the next field behind it is free. The taking checker stands on this free field, jumping over the enemy checker, which is removed from the board. Taking can be done not only forward, but also backward.</p>

                <p>If, during a capture, there are also opponent’s checkers on any of the intersecting diagonals, behind which there are free squares, then the queen is obliged to continue capturing these checkers, no matter how many of them are on her way.</p>
